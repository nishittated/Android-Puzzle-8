# Android application for a Puzzle game.

# Android-Puzzle-8
The idea is to slide tiles around to form an image or to recreate a numerical sequence.

# Here is a physical example of this classic game:

* If you have not seen this game before, each tile can slide either horizontally or vertically into the empty space in order to reorder the tiles.


# For our version of this game, we will not be using numbered tiles but a photo taken by the user with the phone's camera. 
* This is what the UI will look like with an image of a part of Google's (old) logo:

# Puzzle-8 solver
* It is fun to play puzzle-8 for a while but wouldn't it be nice to let the computer solve it for you when you get stuck? You will implement a solver that uses a best-first search algorithm to find the quickest solution to the current puzzle. 
* You will do so by implementing the A* search algorithm, an algorithm from AI that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal.

# Future Enhancements
* Animate the movement of each tile (rather than having them jump into position)
* Support playing the game by swiping the tiles instead of tapping them
* Add a "settings" activity that allow the user to select the desired number of tiles
* Instead of using the thumbnail provided by the ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE intent, try using the full-definition image taken by the camera.
* Allow the user to select taking a new photo or using a photo from their image folder
